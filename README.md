# AppShell
AppShell provides a template for building UWP apps with a standard "hamburger" menu built using SplitView control.
This avoid you to build or copy/paste the menu for each app while not sacrificing flexibility.
AppShell was built starting from "XamlNavigagion" sample project that you can find in [Windows Universal Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples)
